"""
Given an integer representing the number of candles you start with, and an integer representing 
how many burned candles it takes to create a new one, return the number of candles you will have used 
after creating and burning as many as you can.

For example, if given 7 candles and it takes 2 burned candles to make a new one:

Burn 7 candles to get 7 leftovers,
Recycle 6 leftovers into 3 new candles (1 leftover remains),
Burn 3 candles to get 3 more leftovers (4 total),
Recycle 4 leftovers into 2 new candles,
Burn 2 candles to get 2 leftovers,
Recycle 2 leftovers into 1 new candle,
Burn 1 candle.
You will have burned 13 total candles in the example.
