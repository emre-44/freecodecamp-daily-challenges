"""
Given a string, determine if it is a valid IPv4 Address. A valid IPv4 address consists of 
four integer numbers separated by dots (.). Each number must satisfy the following conditions:

It is between 0 and 255 inclusive.
It does not have leading zeros (e.g. 0 is allowed, 01 is not).
Only numeric characters are allowed.
